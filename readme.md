# Open Translation

## Summary

Open Translation is the title I have given to a portion of a larger ambition to create a system of open scholarship on medieval literature. It is a blueprint for how editors and translators of historical texts can make their work more accessible for the benefit of anyone interested in these texts. Editing and translating historical texts is often a long, laborious process, and the results are seldom published or even publishable. Open Translation is a means to leverage digital spaces to make updatable drafts of these texts available for consultation, to allow collaboration on this (often solitary) type of work and to promote the promulgation of trustworthy editions and translations of the historic record. Here is an attempt to create, document and demonstrate a system whereby translations of historical texts can be iteratively produced, updated and used by oneself and others. An academic audience is envisioned in the first instance, but the idea is to make texts as widely available as possible while retaining a measure of confidence in the quality of the translations.

The novelty of this approach lies primarily in the concept of ‘Open’, which I elect to use rather broadly; translations produced through this method are designed to be transparent through immediate comparison with a source text, and anything produced in this fashion will have a generous license to allow others to copy, download, excerpt or do otherwise as they see fit.

Below is a set of stages and considerations which typify the editing and translating process. Each stage bears consideration for how editing and translating work might take place in a digital space. I begin with a very basic scenario: a single editor or translator working on a single text. From this I chart what kinds of work is done and what considerations need to be made. For the entire process I suggest a suite of tools to make the edition or translation Open (in the sense described above), including a text editor (Atom), presentation packages (LaTeX), versioning (Github) and archiving (Zenodo). These tools should be interchangeable as desired, and a final one for some manner of (Open Access) publication should be added when a suitable venue is identified.

This is all a work in progress. At present the material below focuses primarily on translations (editions to come later with a very similar process). I would welcome anyone interested to get in touch via email or just collaborate directly in this repository.

## Stage 1: Source Selection

Translations begin with a choice of source material: what do I want to translate? In the case of historical texts, the source is often an edition, itself based on an original document, such as a manuscript. For simplicity I assume that a translation will be based primarily on a single edition of a text. Methods to suit more complex textual relations can be built upon this skeleton. N.b. it is essential that the edition be used be freely re-used, because a version of it (ideally a stable digital facsimile) will need to be present alongside the translation. In practice this generally means that the source is out of copyright. Having the original text along with the translation allows immediate verification of the translation's accuracy.

## Stage 2: The Draft

As the text is being translated, the draft should be visible when it's at a workable stage. We're all going to make mistakes; we're all going to dither over turns of phrase - we should judge less and help each other with these when possible. If we put our draft online and mark it clearly as a draft and in progress, then there is a possibility of getting more feedback on it. People can also begin to use it (with caution) instead of having the draft sit in limbo in MS Word documents for two, five or twenty years. In the tools section below I also recommend using versioning for this. A single, versioned text file (even with notes and, perhaps, images) is easier to manage than a series of drafts in one's local machine, copies emailed to colleagues, etc.

License the draft. Put a note explicitly stating that people can use your draft (make it CC-BY, why not?).

## Stage 3: The Publication

At some point the translation is 'finished'. The quotes here signify the uneasiness of all translators with labeling their work as done. Regardless, a cutoff must be made, and in Open Translation, this could be a snapshot. This snapshot could take a number of forms, but in principle it should be a stable, citable version of the text. This could be a deposit into a repository with an attached DOI, or it could be a publication with a publisher savvy to handling digital texts. A merit of having the translation online and open is that it can be enhanced or improved upon, for a 2.0 edition if desired.

## Tools

For my case studies of Open Translation I have selected a stack of tools, which include:

- Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads): for establishing version control of your translation document (and accompany documents, if there are any)
- Github (https://github.com/): for hosting your versioned documents online
- LaTeX (https://www.latex-project.org/): for formatting the text in a versionable and human-readable way (e.g. as a PDF)
- Atom (https://atom.io/): a text editor with LaTeX plugins

A step-by-step guide for using these tools would be desirable once it is established that others would find it beneficial to use them in this way. It is entirely possible that other tools be more feasible here: perhaps GoogleDocs for easier collaboration in drafts, or a wiki for drafting and presentation.

## Cases

To show how the Open Translation process, or at least the early parts of it, might work, I have selected a handful of cases, texts that I find interesting and wanted to translate for various purposes.

- an Old Icelandic Charter [need to expand details]
- [travel narrative]
- [etc.?]
